### 🚀 About Me

I’m a motivated Software Engineer with a strong foundation in both **frontend and backend development**, passionate about creating scalable, user-friendly, and impactful digital solutions.

🔹 Skilled in building modern UIs with **React.js/Next.js**, robust APIs with **Node.js/Express/NestJS**, and deploying scalable systems using **Docker**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD pipelines**.  
🔹 Adept at both **team collaboration** and **independent problem solving**, gained through hands-on experience at **Gobi**, **Kumva Insights**, **Andela**, and **ALX**.  
🔹 I enjoy working on real-world problems — from logistics and agriculture to business intelligence platforms — using the right stack for the job.
